"""
Django signals for automatic cache invalidation on Property model changes.

This module implements automatic cache invalidation using Django's signal system
to ensure data consistency between the database and Redis cache.

Why Django signals are necessary for cache invalidation:
1. Automatic cache refresh - no manual intervention needed
2. Data consistency - ensures cache never contains stale data  
3. Real-time updates - cache reflects database changes immediately
4. Development safety - prevents forgot-to-invalidate bugs
5. Production reliability - handles cache invalidation automatically

# - Debug cache invalidation issues in development
